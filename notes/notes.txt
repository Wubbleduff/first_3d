Getting DirectX from a previous practice project to a renderer in the engine.
Lots of organizing data and text transformation. I've grouped meshes so now
it's very easy to create a mesh from a handmade model or loaded from an obj
file. Got from showing a wizard-hat-textured quad to a full 3D diffuse lit
wizard hat. Also implemented a first person camera.
